# CPSC322FinalProject
### Mental Health and Job Correlations

## Topic
This project topic is on the mental health consequences caused by factors related to being in the workforce. We wanted to see if their was a significant relationship between the type of job situation a person is placed in and their mental health. Through different implementations of classifiers, the mental health consequence of a person was predicted to be either "yes", "no", or "maybe".

## Organization
This project is organized into several components. There is a testing file for our classifiers, a myutils file for source code used, and a juptyter notebook for the technical report. The tehcnical report is broken up by introduction, data analysis, classifier results, and conclusion. Within these sections, we utilize ideas such as data cleaning, attribute selection, and visualization. The code is also interleaved with analysis and explanations.

## Data
The data set we are using is called survey.csv which contains data on each participants survy results about the status of work and mental health factors. 

## How to Run
In order to run this project, simply "Run All" on the TechnicalReport.ipynb where our approach and findings can be found. The Jupyter Notebook calls the myutils files and csv file which contains data and code that will be implemented.

## Understand Content
Throughout the technical report, there are printed out results such as charts and confusion matrices. In order to understand what this means, refer to the markdown associated with the code.

## Conclusion
To learn more about the implications of these findings, read the conclusion found in the technical report. This summarizes the classification approach we used and the performance results dervied from it. We also reflect on these findings and how it could be improved in the future.
